# Specification: G10 CPU

Below is a specification for a custom CPU architecture, named "G10". This
document outlines the architecture's features, instruction set, and operational
details.

## Overview

The G10 CPU is a CISC architecture designed for educational purposes, featuring
a straightforward, fixed-length instruction set and a simple memory model, and
drawing inspiration from classic 8-bit CPU designs (namely, those of the Intel
8080, Zilog Z80, and the Nintendo Game Boy's Sharp LR35902). Effectively, this
is basically those architectures reimagined with 32-bit registers and a 32-bit
address space.

### Details

- **Data Width**: 32 bits
    - Supports 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit data types
- **Address Bus**: 32 bits
    - Supports up to 4 GB of addressable memory
- **Endianness**: Little-endian
- **Clock Speed**: 4.194304 MHz (normal speed), 8.388608 MHz (double speed)
- **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**: CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer)
- **Instruction Opcode Length**: 16 bits (2 bytes)

## Memory Layout

The G10 CPU features a flat memory model with a 32-bit address space, which
allows for direct addressing of up to 4 GB of memory. The G10 itself assumes
a very broad memory layout, leaving specific memory mapping details to the
virtual machine hardware powered by the G10 CPU, but does define the following
memory regions, on top of which the VM may build its own memory map:

- **$00000000 - $00000FFF**: Program Metadata
    - This region is reserved for storing useful information about the program,
        such as its entry point, stack pointer initialization value, and other
        metadata (like name, version, author, etc).
- **$00001000 - $00001FFF**: Interrupt Table
    - This region is reserved for the interrupt vector subroutine table, which
        reserves space for up to 32 interrupt vector subroutines, each taking
        `0x80` (128) bytes of space.
- **$00002000 - $7FFFFFFF**: Read-Only Memory (ROM)
    - This region is intended for program code and read-only data.
- **$80000000 - $FFFFFFFF**: Read/Write Memory (RAM)
    - This region is intended for writable data, including the stack.

The general rule of thumb is that any address where bit 31 (the highest bit) is
clear (`$00000000` to `$7FFFFFFF`) is considered read-only memory, while any
address where bit 31 is set (`$80000000` to `$FFFFFFFF`) is considered
read/write memory. All memory is executable, provided that read access is allowed
by the virtual hardware.

### Quick RAM and I/O Ports

Although it is not defined in the G10's broad memory layout, certain instructions
allow for quickly moving data to and from memory at relative 16-bit and 8-bit
addresses. These addresses are relative to addresses `$FFFF0000` and `$FFFFFF00`,
respectively, effectively providing a small "quick RAM" area of 64 KB, and a
smaller "I/O port" region of 256 bytes, for fast access to frequently-used
data.

## Register File

The G10 CPU contains a built-in register file, which consists of sixteen
general-purpose registers, each 32 bits wide, and several special-purpose
registers used for specific functions within the CPU.

### General-Purpose Registers

The general-purpose registers in the G10 CPU's register file can either be
accessed as full 32-bit registers, or as smaller 16-bit or 8-bit registers,
depending on the needs of the instruction being executed. The registers are
named as follows:

- **32-bit Registers**: `D0` to `D15`
- **16-bit Registers**: `W0` to `W15`
    - `Wn` corresponds to the lower 16 bits of `Dn` (e.g., `W0` is bits 0-15 of
        `D0`)
- **8-bit Registers**: `H0` to `H15` (high byte), `L0` to `L15` (low byte)
    - `Hn` corresponds to bits 4-7 of `Dn`
    - `Ln` corresponds to bits 0-3 of `Dn`

#### Accumulator Registers

Registers `D0`, `W0` and `L0` are collectively referred to as the "accumulator"
registers, and are used by certain instructions that specifically operate on the
accumulator. These instructions include arithmetic and logical operations, as
well as certain CPU control instructions.

### Special-Purpose Registers

The special-purpose registers in the G10 CPU's register file play specific roles
in indicating the state of the CPU and controlling its operation. These registers
are as follows:

- **Program Counter (PC)**: A 32-bit register that holds the address of the next
    instruction or immediate data to be fetched from memory.
- **Stack Pointer (SP)**: A 32-bit register that points to the top of the stack
    in the read/write memory region.
    - The stack grows downwards, meaning that pushing data onto the
        stack decrements the SP, while popping data from the stack increments it.
    - The initial value of the SP is typically set to the highest address of the
        read/write memory region (`$FFFFFFFF`), but this can be adjusted as
        needed by the program.
    - Bit 31 of the SP is always set to `1`, ensuring that the stack always
        resides in the read/write memory region.
- **Flags Register (FR)**: An 8-bit register that contains various flags which
    indicate the current state of the CPU. The bits are laid out as follows:

    3. **Overflow Flag (V)**: Indicates whether the last arithmetic operation resulted
        in a signed overflow.
        - For addition operations, this flag is set if the signs of the two operands
            were the same, but the sign of the result is different (e.g. adding two
            positive numbers yields a negative result, adding two negative numbers
            yields a positive result).
        - For subtraction operations, this flag is set if the signs of the two operands
            were different, and the sign of the result is different from the sign
            of the first operand (e.g. subtracting a negative number from a positive
            number yields a negative result, subtracting a positive number from
            a negative number yields a positive result).
    4. **Carry Flag (C)**: Indicates whether the last arithmetic or logical
        operation resulted in a carry out, or a borrow into, the most significant
        bit.
        - For 8-bit operations, this flag is set `(result > 0xFF)` or 
            `(result < 0x00)`.
        - For 16-bit operations, this flag is set `(result > 0xFFFF)` or 
            `(result < 0x0000)`.
        - For 32-bit operations, this flag is set `(result > 0xFFFFFFFF)` or 
            `(result < 0x00000000)`.
        - This flag is used as a conditional check for branching instructions.
    5. **Half-Carry Flag (H)**: Indicates whether the last arithmetic operation
        resulted in a carry out, or a borrow into, a certain bit position.
        - For 8-bit operations, this flag is set if `(result & 0xF) > 0xF` or
            `(result < 0x0)`.
        - For 16-bit operations, this flag is set if `(result & 0xFFF) > 0xFFF` or
            `(result < 0x0)`.
        - For 32-bit operations, this flag is set if 
            `(result & 0xFFFFFFF) > 0xFFFFFFF` or `(result < 0x0)`.
        - This flag is primarily used for BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) arithmetic.
    6. **Negative (Subtract) Flag (N)**: Indicates whether the last arithmetic
        operation was a subtraction.
        - This flag is set if the last arithmetic operation was a subtraction,
            and cleared if it was an addition.
        - This flag is primarily used for BCD (Binary-Coded Decimal) arithmetic.
    7. **Zero Flag (Z)**: Indicates whether the result of the last arithmetic
        or logical operation was zero.
        - This flag is set if the result is zero, and cleared otherwise.
        - This flag is used as a conditional check for branching instructions.

- **Stop Flag**: This flag register indicates that the CPU is in an 
    ultra-low-power `STOP` state.
    - If this flag is set, the CPU's clock is disabled entirely, halting all
        operations (instruction execution, interrupts, etc.) until the flag is cleared.
    - This flag is set by executing the `STOP` instruction.
    - This flag is also set automatically if a Double Fault has occured.
        See the **Exception Code** section below for more details.
    - This flag must be cleared explicitly by the virtual machine, via some
        external event (e.g., a hardware reset or a button press).
    - If this flag was set due to a Double Fault, it can only be cleared via 
        a hardware reset.
- **Halt Flag**: This flag register indicates that the CPU is in a low-power 
    `HALT` state.
    - If this flag is set, the CPU stops executing instructions, but
        continues to respond to interrupts. Unlike the `STOP` state, the CPU's
        clock remains active while in the `HALT` state.
    - This flag is set by executing the `HALT` instruction.
    - This flag is cleared when an enabled interrupt is pending.
- **Interrupt Master Enable Register (IME)**: This flag register controls whether 
    the CPU will respond to and service interrupts.
    - If this flag is set, the CPU will respond to and service enabled
        interrupts when they are pending.
    - If this flag is clear, the CPU will ignore all interrupts, even if they
        are enabled and pending.
    - This flag is set by executing the `EI`, `EII` or `RETI` instructions.
        - `EI` enables interrupts after the next instruction is executed.
            See the **Interrupt Master Pending Flag (IMP)** below for more details.
        - `EII` and `RETI` enable interrupts immediately.
    - This flag is cleared by executing the `DI` instruction, or when an
        interrupt is acknowledged and is about to be serviced.
    - Interrupt vector #0 (the highest-priority interrupt, used for exception
        handling) is always serviced, regardless of the state of this flag.
- **Interrupt Master Pending Register (IMP)**: This flag register indicates that 
    the IME flag is scheduled to be set after the next instruction is executed.
    - This flag is set by executing the `EI` instruction.
    - This flag is cleared after the next instruction is executed, at which
        point the IME flag is also set.
    - This flag has no effect on interrupt servicing; it simply indicates
        that the IME flag will be set soon.
- **Interrupt Enable Register (IE)**: A 32-bit register that controls which
    interrupts are enabled.
    - Each bit in this register corresponds to a specific interrupt vector.
    - If a bit is set, the corresponding interrupt is enabled; if it is clear,
        the interrupt is disabled.
    - Bit 0 of this register, which corresponds to interrupt vector #0 (the
        exception handler), is always set and cannot be cleared.
- **Interrupt Request Register (IRQ)**: A 32-bit register that indicates which
    interrupts are currently pending.
    - Each bit in this register corresponds to a specific interrupt vector.
    - If a bit is set, the corresponding interrupt is pending; if it is clear,
        the interrupt is not pending.
    - If an interrupt is both enabled (its bit in the `IE` register is set) and
        pending (its bit in the `IRQ` register is set), and the `IME` flag is also
        set, the CPU will service the interrupt.
- **Exception Code Register (EC)**: An 8-bit register that holds the code of an
    exception which was raised. See the **Exceptions** section below for more
    details.
- **Double Fault Flag**: A flag that indicates whether a Double Fault condition
    has occurred. See the **Double Faults** subsection below for more details.

## Interrupts

The G10 CPU supports a simple interrupt mechanism, allowing virtual hardware
to request the CPU's attention and temporarily halt its current execution flow
to service an interrupt. The CPU can handle up to 32 different interrupt vectors,
each corresponding to a specific interrupt source. These interrupts are
prioritized, with lower-numbered interrupt vectors having higher priority.

Interrupt checking and servicing occurs between the execution of instructions.
In a frame of execution, this is performed after the `STOP` state check and
before the fetching of the next instruction opcode. The following steps are
taken to check for and service interrupts:

1. If the `HALT` flag is set, the CPU checks for any enabled and pending
    interrupts. If such an interrupt exists, the CPU clears the `HALT` flag.
    Otherwise, if no enabled and pending interrupts exist, the CPU remains in the
    `HALT` state and does not proceed to fetch the next instruction.
2. If the `IME` flag is set, the CPU iterates through the 32 bits of the `IE` and
    `IRQ` registers, starting from bit 0 (the highest-priority interrupt vector)
    to bit 31 (the lowest-priority interrupt vector). For each bit position `i`:
    - If bit `i` in both the `IE` and `IRQ` registers is set, that interrupt is
        ready to be serviced.
3. If an interrupt is found to be ready to be serviced, the interrupt is
    first acknowledged by the CPU:
    - The corresponding bit `i` in the `IRQ` register is cleared.
    - The `IME` flag is cleared to prevent further interrupts from being
        serviced while the current interrupt is being handled.
    - If, for some reason, the `HALT` flag is still set at this point, it is
        cleared.
4. The CPU then proceeds to service the interrupt:
    - The current value of the `PC` register is pushed onto the stack.
        - High byte first, followed by the low byte.
    - The `PC` register is then loaded with the starting address of the interrupt
        vector subroutine, calculated as `$1000 + (i * 0x80)`, where `i` is the
        interrupt vector number.
    - This process consumes five machine cycles: two for a wait state, two for the
        stack push operation, and one for loading the new `PC` value.
5. After instruction execution completes, if the `IMP` flag is set, the `IME` 
    flag is set, and the `IMP` flag is cleared.

The G10 reserves the memory region from `$00001000` to `$00001FFF` for the
interrupt vector subroutine table, allowing for up to 32 interrupt vector
subroutines, each taking `0x80` (128) bytes of space.

## Exceptions

The G10 CPU includes a basic exception handling mechanism to manage unexpected
conditions (usually, severe errors) that occur during program execution. If, at
any time during the operation of the CPU or the virtual hardware it powers, an
exception is raised, the CPU will automatically transition to an exception handling
routine to address the issue. This routine is located at interrupt vector #0,
(address `$1000`) which is reserved specifically for exception handling.

The following exception codes are defined in the G10 CPU:

- `0x00`: **`OK`**
    - Indicates that no exception has occurred.
    - If the exception-raising mechanism is invoked with this code, no action is
        taken by the CPU.
- `0x01`: **`INVALID_INSTRUCTION`**
    - Raised when the CPU encounters an instruction opcode that is not
        recognized as a valid instruction in the G10 instruction set.
- `0x02`: **`INVALID_ARGUMENT`**
    - Raised when an instruction is executed with an argument that is not valid
        for that instruction (e.g., an invalid register, an out-of-bounds memory
        address, etc).
- `0x03`: **`INVALID_READ_ACCESS`**
    - Raised by the virtual hardware when a read operation is attempted on a
        memory address which it does not allow reading from.
    - The normal behavior of the CPU is not to raise this exception itself, but
        rather read an open-bus value (`0xFF`) instead. This exception is intended
        to be raised by the virtual hardware if it wants to enforce stricter
        access control.
- `0x04`: **`INVALID_WRITE_ACCESS`**
    - Raised by the CPU if a write operation is attempted on a read-only memory
        address (i.e., any address where bit 31 is clear, `$00000000` to
        `$7FFFFFFF`).
    - Raised by the virtual hardware when a write operation is attempted on a
        memory address which it does not allow writing to.
    - Other than the read-only memory check performed by the CPU itself, the normal
        behavior of the CPU is not to raise this exception itself, but rather
        ignore the write operation. This exception is intended to be raised by
        the virtual hardware if it wants to enforce stricter access control.
- `0x05`: **`INVALID_EXECUTE_ACCESS`**
    - Raised by the CPU if attempting to fetch an instruction opcode from memory
        results in an `INVALID_READ_ACCESS` exception being raised.
- `0x06`: **`DIVIDE_BY_ZERO`**
    - Raised by the CPU if executing an instruction involves a division or modulus
        operation where the divisor is zero.
    - No such instructions are defined in the base G10 instruction set, but this
        exception is provided for potential future instructions or extensions
        that may involve division or modulus operations.
- `0x07`: **`STACK_OVERFLOW`**
    - Raised by the CPU if a stack push operation (either via the `PUSH`
        instruction or during interrupt/exception servicing) results in an
        `INVALID_WRITE_ACCESS` exception being raised (i.e., if the stack pointer
        winds up pointing to invalid or unmapped memory).
- `0x08`: **`STACK_UNDERFLOW`**
    - Raised by the CPU if a stack pop operation (via the `POP`, `RET`, or `RETI`
        instructions) results in an `INVALID_READ_ACCESS` exception being raised
        (i.e., if the stack pointer winds up pointing to invalid or unmapped
        memory).
- `0x09`: **`HARDWARE_ERROR`**
    - Raised by the virtual hardware to indicate that an error has occured during
        a hardware component's clocking operations.
    - This exception is intended to be raised by the virtual hardware itself,
        rather than the CPU.
- `0x0A`: **`DOUBLE_FAULT`**
    - Can be raised by the virtual hardware to force a **Double Fault** condition,
        even if no other exception is currently being handled.
    - Useful for debugging/testing purposes, or for simulating severe hardware
        failures.

When an exception is raised, the following steps are taken by the CPU:

1. The exception code is written to the `EC` (Exception Code) register. This
    code provides information about the type of exception that occurred.
2. Interrupt vector #0 is serviced immediately. The steps for servicing an
    interrupt, as outlined in the **Interrupts** section above, are followed.
    This includes pushing the current `PC` onto the stack and loading the `PC`
    with the address of the exception handler routine. The `IME` flag is ignored
    during this process, ensuring that the exception handler is always executed.

During the execution of the exception handler routine, when an `RETI` instruction
is executed, the `EC` register is cleared (set to `0x00`, indicating no exception),
and normal execution resumes from the point where the exception occurred (the
`PC` is restored from the stack).

If, at any point while servicing an exception (including while executing the
exception handler routine), another exception is raised, a **Double Fault** occurs.

### Double Faults

A **Double Fault** is a critical condition that arises when an exception occurs
while the CPU is already in the process of handling another exception. This
situation indicates a severe problem, from which the CPU is not allowed to
recover normally.

A Double Fault condition can occur in the following scenarios:

- An exception is raised while the CPU is executing the exception handler
    routine for a previous exception (raised when `EC` is non-zero).
- An exception is raised while the CPU is in the middle of servicing the
    exception handling interrupt (interrupt vector #0) in response to a previous
    exception.
- A `DOUBLE_FAULT` exception is explicitly raised.

When a Double Fault condition occurs, the CPU sets the `T` (Stop) register, placing 
the CPU into the `STOP` state. If the CPU is placed into the `STOP` state due to 
a Double Fault, it can only be exited via a hardware reset. This measure is taken 
to prevent further complications and to ensure that the system can be brought back 
to a known good state through an external reset.

## Instructions

The G10 CPU features a rich, fixed-length instruction set, designed to provide a
wide range of operations while maintaining simplicity and ease of use. Each
instruction is 16 bits (2 bytes) long, allowing for a compact representation of
operations. The instruction set includes various categories of instructions,
such as data movement, arithmetic and logic operations, control flow, stack
manipulation, and special operations.

### Instruction Layout

An instruction in the G10 CPU is represented by a 16-bit operation code
(henceforth, an "opcode"). The bits of the opcode are laid out as follows:

```
0bIIIIIIII XXXX YYYY
```

Where:
- `IIIIIIII` (bits 15-8) represents the 8-bit instruction identifier, which 
    specifies the operation to be performed.
- `XXXX` (bits 7-4) and `YYYY` (bits 3-0) are 4-bit fields representing up to
    two built-in arguments for the instruction. The meaning of these fields
    depends on the specific instruction being executed, and can represent
    registers, branching conditions, or other instruction-specific parameters.
    - It's important to note that an instruction's built-in arguments are
        separate from any immediate data that may be needed by the instruction,
        and immediately follow the instruction opcode in memory.

### Instruction Length

All instruction opcodes in the G10 CPU are fixed at 16 bits (2 bytes) in length
at minimum. However, some instructions may require additional immediate data
to be provided, which follows the opcode in memory. Instructions in the G10 CPU
can be 2 bytes (opcode only), 3 bytes (opcode + 1 byte immediate), 4 bytes
(opcode + 2 bytes immediate), or 6 bytes (opcode + 4 bytes immediate) in total
length, depending on the specific instruction and its requirements.

### Instruction Timing

An instruction's execution time can be measured in one of two ways: CPU clock
cycles (tick cycles, or "T-cycles"), or virtual machine clock cycles (machine
cycles, or "M-cycles"). The distinction between these two timing methods is as
as follows: One M-cycle consists of four T-cycles.

In the G10 CPU, T-cycles are quite often (in fact, just about always) consumed
in multiples of four, meaning that most instructions will take a whole number of
M-cycles to execute, with very little exception (in fact, at this point, there
are no exceptions to this rule). As such, instruction timing will be specified in
M-cycles throughout this document.

An M-cycle is consumed every time the CPU:
- Reads a byte from memory (including fetching instruction opcodes and immediate data)
- Writes a byte to memory (including during stack push/pop operations)
- Moves the `SP` register (during stack push/pop operations)
- Moves the `PC` register (during jumps, calls, returns, interrupts, and exceptions)
- Performs a lengthy arithmetic operation (such as a 16- or 32-bit addition or subtraction,
    or a multiplication or division operation)
- Performs a wait state (prior to servicing interrupts or handling exceptions)

Every time a T-cycle is consumed, the CPU's internal clock is advanced by one
tick, causing all virtual hardware components attached to the CPU's bus to tick
and perform their own operations as needed.

### Instruction Set

The G10 CPU's instruction set is organized into several categories, each
containing instructions that perform related functions. The categories include:

- **`0x0***`: CPU Control Instructions**
- **`0x1***`: 8-Bit Load / Store / Move Instructions**
- **`0x2***`: 16-Bit Load / Store / Move Instructions**
- **`0x3***`: 32-Bit Load / Store / Move Instructions + Stack Operations**
- **`0x4***`: Branching Instructions**
- **`0x5***`: 8-Bit Arithmetic Instructions**
- **`0x6***`: 16-Bit and 32-Bit Arithmetic Instructions**
- **`0x7***`: 8-Bit Bitwise and Logical Instructions**
- **`0x8***`: Bit Shift and Swap Instructions**
- **`0x9***`: Bit Rotate Instructions**
- **`0xA***`: Bit Test and Manipulation Instructions**

Each instruction within these categories is defined by its unique opcode and
specific operation. Detailed descriptions of each instruction, including its
function, operands, and timing, are provided in the subsequent sections of this
document.

The tables below outline the instructions in each category, with each column
therein representing the following information:

- **Opcode & Mnemonic**: The 16-bit opcode of the instruction, along with its
    mnemonic (human-readable name). This may include placeholders for built-in
    arguments (e.g., `X`, `Y`).
    - Certain instructions may also have aliases, which are alternative mnemonics
        that refer to the same opcode. These aliases will be listed in the
        **Aliases** subsection below the corresponding instruction table.
- **Length**: The total length of the instruction in bytes, including any
    immediate data.
- **Timing**: The execution time of the instruction in M-cycles. This may be
    specified as one or more fixed values, depending on the specific operation 
    being performed (such as in the case of branching instructions).
- **Flags**: The flags in the Flags Register (`FR`) that are affected by the
    instruction.
    - This will be listed in the following format: `ZNHCV`, where each letter
        corresponds to a specific flag:
        - `Z`: Zero Flag
        - `N`: Negative (Subtract) Flag
        - `H`: Half-Carry Flag
        - `C`: Carry Flag
        - `V`: Overflow Flag
    - How the flag is affected (if at all) will be indicated as follows:
        - `-`: Unchanged
        - `0`: Cleared (set to `0`)
        - `1`: Set (set to `1`)
        - `?`: Set or cleared based on the result of the operation. See the
            **Notes** subsection below the coresponding instruction table for
            further details.
    - If an instruction affects a flag other than the four listed above, those
        flags will be listed as follows: `F=S`, where `F` is the flag being affected,
        and `S` is how it is affected (using the same notation as above).
    - If the **Flags** column for a given instruction is left blank, it indicates
        that the instruction does not affect any flags.
    - If a given instruction table does not have a **Flags** column, it indicates
        that none of the instructions in that particular category affect any flags.
- **Description**: A brief description of the instruction's operation.

#### `0x0***`: CPU Control Instructions

The **CPU Control Instructions** are used to manage the overall state and
operation of the G10 CPU. These instructions allow for enabling and disabling

#### `0x4***`: Branching Instructions

The **Branching Instructions** are used to control the flow of execution in a
program. These instructions allow for conditional and unconditional jumps,
calls, and returns, enabling the implementation of loops, subroutines, and
conditional logic.

Most of these instructions expect an execution condition, specified by the
`X` built-in argument. The conditions are as follows:

- **`0x0: NC`: No Condition**
    - The instruction is always executed, regardless of the state of any flags.
- **`0x1: ZS`: Zero Set**
    - The instruction is executed if the Zero flag (`Z`) is set.
- **`0x2: ZC`: Zero Clear**
    - The instruction is executed if the Zero flag (`Z`) is clear.
- **`0x3: CS`: Carry Set**
    - The instruction is executed if the Carry flag (`C`) is set.
- **`0x4: CC`: Carry Clear**
    - The instruction is executed if the Carry flag (`C`) is clear.
- **`0x5: VS`: Overflow Set**
    - The instruction is executed if the Overflow flag (`V`) is set.
- **`0x6: VC`: Overflow Clear**
    - The instruction is executed if the Overflow flag (`V`) is clear.

##### Notes

- `0x40X0 JMP X, IMM32`:
    - Timing is `6 M-cycles` if the jump is not taken; `7 M-cycles` if the jump is taken.
- `0x41XY JMP X, DY`:
    - Timing is `2 M-cycles` if the jump is not taken; `3 M-cycles` if the jump is taken.
- `0x42X0 JPB X, SIMM16`:
    - Timing is `4 M-cycles` if the jump is not taken; `5 M-cycles` if the jump is taken.
- `0x43X0 CALL X, IMM32`:
    - Timing is `6 M-cycles` if the call is not taken; `12 M-cycles` if the call is taken.
- `0x44XX INT XX`:
    - `XX` must be between `0x00` and `0x1F` (0 to 31). An attempt to call an
        invalid interrupt vector will result in an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` exception.
- `0x45X0 RET X`:
    - Timing is `3 M-cycles` if the return is conditional and not taken;
        `9 M-cycles` if the return is conditional and taken;
        `8 M-cycles` if the return is unconditional.

##### Aliases

- `JMP`, `JPB`, `CALL` and `RET` instructions invoked with no execution condition
    explicitly specified (i.e., using the mnemonic without the `X` built-in argument,
    like `JMP IMM32`, `JPB SIMM16`, `CALL IMM32`, or `RET`) are aliases for the
    corresponding instructions with the `NC` (No Condition) execution condition.
    (e.g. `JMP IMM32` is the same as `JMP NC, IMM32`, `RET` is the same as `RET NC`).
- `JP` is an alias for all of the `JMP` instructions.
- `JR` is an alias for all of the `JPB` instructions.

#### `0xA***`: Bit Test and Manipulation Instructions

The **Bit Test and Manipulation Instructions** are used to test, set, clear,
and toggle individual bits in 8-bit registers or memory locations. These
instructions facilitate bit-level operations, which are often used in low-level
programming and hardware control.
